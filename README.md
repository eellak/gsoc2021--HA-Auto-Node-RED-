# HA-Auto 
The goal of the project is to develop a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that will enable users to program complex 
automation scenarios, for connected IoT devices, that go beyond simple automation rules. To make use of this DSL even 
easier for the end user, the language will be integrated in Node-RED’s flow-based low-code environment.
The project’s brief description can also be found in GFOSS’s 2021 GSoC Proposed Ideas.
